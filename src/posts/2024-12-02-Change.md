I've had a lot of opportunities to think about things I regret. I regret doing something, I regret not doing something, I regret doing something a certain way. Most of them are fairly small, but I think about some of them quite a lot.

But as of late, I've thought about what I would *actually* change about what I did in the past, if I was given the chance. And my ultimate conclusion... was nothing.

Nothing. Not a thing. This may just be because all in all I don't like uncertainty, but it's because by and large I *like* where my life is now. I *like* the friends that I have, the things that I'm doing, and I don't want to lose that. And that's not a certainty that I would have if I changed anything. I've seen far too many movies, TV shows, and books about time travel and the butterfly effect to think that everything would still be as it "should" be if I changed an action that I regret.

I am who I am today, with the friends I have today, because of the sum of the actions that I have taken. The good, the bad, all of it. All of that is me, and I would not change that for the world.
