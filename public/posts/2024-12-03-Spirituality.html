          <p>My relationship with spirituality and religion is a complicated one. To start with, I was born and raised in an interfaith household. My father was raised Jewish and my mother raised Catholic.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, neither one of them was particularly religious. My mother really only went to church as an afterthought, and I have no idea when the last time my father went to temple was. We celebrated a handful of holidays from each faith, mostly as an excuse to celebrate together. Christmas, Hanukkah, Easter, Passover, et cetera.</p>
<p>I can honestly say that I never felt that much of a connection to either of my family's religions. Throughout most of my life I have identified myself as agnostic.</p>
<p>As time passes and I get older, though, I find myself wanting to connect more with my cultural identity. Christianity is everywhere, being a majority cultural group in America Christian and Christian<em>ized</em> symbols are pervasive, not that that's necessarily a bad thing. But given that, I felt that I should connect more with my cultural identity as a Jew first. And in my time in college, I have tried and succeeded in doing that. I don't (and sometimes <em>can't</em>) do some of the more strict religious observances, but I have sat with Jewish friends of mine for Shabbat, discussing all sorts of things and cracking jokes by candlelight. I have attended temple for the first time in my own memory, and it was beautiful. I have deep, rich discussions about Jewish culture and scripture and how they inter-relate even in the absence of absolute faith in God. I've even started learning Yiddish, the nearly-dead language of the Jewish diaspora in Europe, a language some of my ancestors spoke.</p>
<p>It's been a deeply satisfying experience. Even without a definite faith, even as I continue to call myself agnostic since I am unsure exactly what my fluctuating faith in a higher power might be defined as, connecting with such a rich and colorful culture through the lens of faith is something I will never regret.</p>
