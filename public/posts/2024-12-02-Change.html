          <p>I've had a lot of opportunities to think about things I regret. I regret doing something, I regret not doing something, I regret doing something a certain way. Most of them are fairly small, but I think about some of them quite a lot.</p>
<p>But as of late, I've thought about what I would <em>actually</em> change about what I did in the past, if I was given the chance. And my ultimate conclusion... was nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing. Not a thing. This may just be because all in all I don't like uncertainty, but it's because by and large I <em>like</em> where my life is now. I <em>like</em> the friends that I have, the things that I'm doing, and I don't want to lose that. And that's not a certainty that I would have if I changed anything. I've seen far too many movies, TV shows, and books about time travel and the butterfly effect to think that everything would still be as it &quot;should&quot; be if I changed an action that I regret.</p>
<p>I am who I am today, with the friends I have today, because of the sum of the actions that I have taken. The good, the bad, all of it. All of that is me, and I would not change that for the world.</p>
